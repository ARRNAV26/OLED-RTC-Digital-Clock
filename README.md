                This is a bona fide work carried out by ARNAV SAHA under the supervision of Prof. Lalit P. Patil and 
                it is approved for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Project based learning 
                of S.E. E&TC â€“ 2019 Course of the Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune.

               This project uses the Arduino open-source framework and is intended to show the time and date digitally
               and in analog format and also have a feature of ringing an alarm at a specific instant of time.
               
               The Arduino Uno Rev3 board is used here which receives an external power supply of approximately 5V DC
               which is transmitted to a DS1307 RTC module which calculates and stores the time in days, months and 
               years and stores it in a 2KB EEPROM which is received by the Arduino board which reads the data sent 
               to it and displays it on the SSD1306 OLED Display and rings an alarm as programmed.
